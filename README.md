# Neural_net


In this code I am trying to implement Artificial Neural Network using Numpy libraries in Python based on Andrew Trask Blog http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/27/python-network-part2/.
I personally recommend anyone who is starting his journey in Data Science to follow Andrew Trask. His explanation makes tricky topic intuitive.
